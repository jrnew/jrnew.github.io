### My Monday schedule

Too many talks, too little time. This is an update of my schedule after staring at the full schedules a bit more closely. Look out for my notes on these talks later this week!

(Sunday didn't happen because of countless flight delays and major sleep deprivation as a result. But hey, I got a surprise stopover at Toronto that was great!)
