It's been maybe two and half years since my last attempt at getting a blog going, and a confluence of factors is reviving this effort once more. They are:

* An itch to scratch and some spare time
* Reading [Rachel Thomas'](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)
* Heading to the [KDD conference](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/) soon, which should provide some starting material for the blog
* Inspiration/peer pressure from the folks I stalk on Twitter, including coworker Ray and his [analysis of foreign language learning using Duolingo data](https://runze.github.io/2017/07/02/an-analysis-of-foreign-language-learning-using-duolingo-data/) 

Well, let's see how things go!
