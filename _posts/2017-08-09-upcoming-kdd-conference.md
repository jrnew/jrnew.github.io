### Hello Halifax!

[KDD 2017](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/) is happening Aug 13-17 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I first heard of Nova Scotia when my middle school history teacher told us his retirement dream is to fish in Nova Scotia, so it does make me wonder if there will be an incremental increase in data folks retiring in Nova Scotia in future as a result of this conference.

Halifax doesn't strike me as an obvious choice as a location for a big conference, but I'm pretty excited to explore a different part of Canada. Sidenote: For what I would think is a prety quiet and peaceful part of the world, Halifax has actually seen some pretty big disasters. [This](http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/news/mn-19758) was an interesting read.
